# Crack The Gate 1
**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Difficulty:** Easy

## 📝 Description
*We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out? The website is running here. Can you try to log in?*


## Analysis:
We are given a login page and we asked to login with the known email but we don't have the password. First, i try to inspect the web page.

Here we can see HTML Comments. It ask to remove the comment before pushing to production. The first comment seems like a ROT13 strings. Let's try to rotate it again.

There it is. We got the instruction for temporary bypass just by use header **X-Dev-Access: yes**.
    
## Exploit:
To exploit, we just need to add **X-Dev-Access: yes** into the HTTP request header.
